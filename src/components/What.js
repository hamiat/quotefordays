        The web is a tool that people use to can talk and share information.

        <p>A tool is something that you can use to do or make something.</p>

        <p>A hammer is a tool that you can use to hit a nail.</p>

        <p>A book is a tool that you can use to learn something new. </p>

          The web is also a tool that you can use to learn something new or get
          information (on trees)...

        <p>
          ... and a tool that can be used to do many other things. But more on
